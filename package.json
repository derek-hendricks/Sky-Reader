  "description": "Lightning Reader's purpose is to heighten your online reading experience. The real hope, however, behind this project is to make the actual process of reading itself more enjoyable and digestible. The attempt to achieve this (at least partially) is made through the use of line gradients, enhanced formatting customizability, and optional 'lightning reading'(speed reading). This is just the initial release, and a ton more is backlogged for future improvements. If you notice and issues, please let me know. More importantly, however, if you have any suggestions, I'd love to know what you think!",
